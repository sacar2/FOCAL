# FOCAL Fashion
iOS app for Ryerson capstone fashion show 2016

Merging fashion and Technology at the 2016 show, the app will be used to bring the focus back into fashion. Users will use QR code scanners on the app to gain information about pieces. The app will also provide background information for attendees on the FOCAL show, it's designers, and the lines.

- Coded in Swift
- Auto Layout was used to format components
- Utilized CocoaPods to implement a countdown to the time of the fashion show
- Implemented a QR code scanner, allowing users to scan QR codes related to pieces that models were wearing, which loaded related outfit details using AVFoundation
- Animated GIFS instead of still images
